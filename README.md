# Sorting_Visualizer
Just download and run the index file and there you go, you can see 10 sorting visuzlizations, change the array or change the visualization speed for better understanding

Implemented algorithms:
 1) Bubble sort
 2) Selection sort
 3) Insertion sort
 4) Merge sort
 5) Quick sort
 6) Heap sort
 7) Cycle Sort
 8) Counting Sort
 9) Bucket Sort
10) Radix Sort

Features:
1) Colored representation of step being executed (For Comparison Based Algorithm).
  1.1) rgb(7, 178, 171):default
  1.2) Yellow: Being compared
  1.3) Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved
  1.4) Green: In correct position 

2) Colored representation of step being executed (For Counting Based Algorithm (I am considering bucket sort also here)).
  2.1) rgb(7, 178, 171) : default
  2.2) lightblue: being counted
  2.3) lightgreen: being copied to other array
  2.4) green: in correct position (for radix it will be green also when the corresponding digits are in correct position)

3) 3 Controls for visualizations
  2.1) Speed of visualization (6 speed levels)
  2.2) Data size ()
  2.3) Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data).

4) Time and Space complexity of algorithm being visualized.
